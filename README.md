# Silent Failure: innerHTML on a Non-Existent Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript related to using `innerHTML` on a DOM element that does not yet exist.  The script executes without throwing an error, but the intended effect (modifying the element's content) is not achieved.

The bug highlights the importance of ensuring elements exist before attempting to manipulate their properties.  The solution demonstrates a robust approach that checks for the element's existence.
